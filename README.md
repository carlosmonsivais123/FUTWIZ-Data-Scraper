# FUTWIZ-Data-Scraper
Used Python's Scrapy to extract data from https://www.futwiz.com/en/fifa20/players where I scrapped every single player in the games attributes, card type, and pricing history since the beginning of the game using ethical web scrapping practices. This was the first step to analyzing the data, formatting it and putting it into a readable way to read it into Python and start my analysis for my FIFA Ultimate Team 2020 Gold Players Dashboard Page.
